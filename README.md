Code and Simulation Files for Master's Thesis: Effect of Wind Shear on Power Production and Loads on a 15 MW Offshore Wind Turbine.
This repository contains all Python code and simulation scripts developed for the master's thesis "Effect of Wind Shear on Power Production and Loads on a 15 MW Offshore Wind Turbine" (University of Bergen, 2025).
The codebase implements a wind turbine model using Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory and includes modules for:

Visualization of offshore wind farm areas and turbine geometry.
Download and processing of NORA3 wind data.
Generation of wind profiles based on power law using both a continuous method and a vertical zonal averaging method.
Wind shear simulations using both synthetic profiles and real LiDAR measurements.
Calculation of aerodynamic forces, power output, and flapwise/edgewise bending moments for each blade section.

The scripts are designed to support analysis of seasonal and site-specific wind conditions.
The repository promotes transparency, reproducibility, and further research in large-scale offshore wind turbine modeling.

For implementation details and context, please refer to the accompanying thesis.
